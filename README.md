Mobile version for Dronos UTM.
This project is mainly using  [MapBox SDK](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps) and [DJI Mobile SDK](http://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/).

## Get Started Immediately

### Dronos UTM Installation with CocoaPods

Since this project has been integrated with [DJI iOS UX SDK CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/DJI-UXSDK-iOS) now, please check the following steps to install **DJISDK.framework** using CocoaPods after you downloading this project:

**1.** Install CocoaPods

Open Terminal and change to the download project's directory, enter the following command to install it:

~~~
sudo gem install cocoapods
~~~

The process may take a long time, please wait. For further installation instructions, please check [this guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

**2.** Install Dronos UTM and DJIWidget with CocoaPods in the Project

Run the following command in the **SwiftCode** paths:

~~~
pod install
~~~

If you install it successfully, you should get the messages similar to the following:

~~~

**3.** Setup Mapbox

Open Terminal and change to the home directory, enter the following command to install it:

~~~
vi .netrc
~~~

Then paste this below code

~~~
machine api.mapbox.com
login mapbox
password <secret key>
~~~

**Note** Please take note it is secret key not a token key. **Secret key** look like this (sk.eyJ1IjoienZoaXI5OCIsIm.......) while **Token key** look like this (pk.Gp6YnczaGYwM2p6Mm.......)


### Run Sample Code

Developers will need to set up the App Key by editing the sample code's info.plist, [after generating their unique App Key](https://developer.dji.com/mobile-sdk/documentation/quick-start/index.html#generate-an-app-key).

For the Swift sample app, the **DJISDKAppKey** is present in the "Info.plist" - developers just need to add their unique key.
In both cases, developers will still need to update the [Bundle Identifier](http://developer.dji.com/user/mobile-sdk/ios-configuration/).

One of DJI's aircraft or handheld cameras will be required to run the sample application.
