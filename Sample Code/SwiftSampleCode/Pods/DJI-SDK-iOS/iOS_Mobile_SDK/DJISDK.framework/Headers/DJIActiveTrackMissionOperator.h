/**
 *  The active track mission operator is the only object that controls, runs and
 *  monitors ActiveTrack Missions. It can be accessed from `DJIMissionControl`.
 *   An ActiveTrack Mission allows an aircraft to track a moving subject using the
 *  vision system and without a GPS tracker on the subject. To use an ActiveTrack
 *  mission:
 *   - Prepare a mission with the rectangle that best represents the target to track
 *   - Start the mission to initiate tracking of the object and begin the state
 *  updates (`currentState`)
 *   - At this point, the aircraft will track the target while hovering in place.
 *   - Give confirmation that the tracked target is correct with
 *  `acceptConfirmationWithCompletion` and the aircraft will begin flying relative
 *  to the target. For Mavic Air 2 and DJI Air 2S, only CIRCLE mode need to be
 *  confirmation.
 *   - If the tracking algorithm looses sufficient confidence in tracking the
 *  target, then the aircraft will stop flying relative to the object and either
 *  notify the user (through execution state) that the target is lost or it needs
 *  another confirmation that the target is correct.
 *   - If you want to pause the mission, you can swith the mission mode to
 *  `DJIActiveTrackModeSpotlight`, the aircraft will hover in place, but continue
 *  tracking the target by adjusting gimbal pitch and aircraft yaw.
 *   - If you want to resume the mission, You can switch the mission mode to track
 *  mode again, confirmation of tracking rectangle will need to be sent through to
 *  start flying relative to target. (For Mavic Air 2 and DJI Air 2S, there is no
 *  need to confirm when you switch mode, Since there is no obstacle avoidance
 *  system on the left and right sides, be especially careful in the CIRCLE mode.)
 *   - The mission can be canceled with `stopMissionWithCompletion` at any time. -
 *  `stopMissionWithCompletion` should also be used to reject tracking confirmation
 *  if the camera is tracking the wrong target. After stopping the mission, the
 *  mission needs to be recreated with a new rectangle and loaded into the operator.
 *   - The main camera is used to track the target, so gimbal cannot be adjusted
 *  during an ActiveTrack mission.
 *   - During the mission the aircraft can be manually flown with roll and throttle.
 *  Pitch,yaw and gimbal are automatically controlled to continue tracking the
 *  target.
 *   - If the mission is executing, and after confirmation of the tracking rectangle
 *  has been sent, the aircraft can be manually controlled horizontally similar to a
 *  `DJIFlightOrientationModeHomeLock` where the home is the tracked target. If
 *  aircraft is manually controlled upward, the aircraft will lift and retreat, and
 *  if it is controlled downward, it will go down and get closer to the target.
 *   - For Mavic Air 2 and DJI Air 2S, you can use the ActiveTrack Mission in the
 *  Normal, Sport, Tripod flight modes. Because obstacle sensing is disabled in
 *  sport mode, so please use ActiveTrack Mission in an open area.
